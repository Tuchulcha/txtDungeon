* Designplan
A simple game for learning a bit of python and how to use git and github together. This document is for making some sort of starting outline of the project.
** Overview
A text based game where you create a character and fight monsters one by one until you win or until you die. 
** Code style
Apparently we are doing Class objects with first letter capital syntax.
Examples: Map, Die, Character
May I suggest function name syntax: all lower-case letters, "-" between tags
Example: this-function-foo
And for variables i suggest all lower-case letters, "_" between tags
Example: number_of_sides_foo
*** Design in the form of questions:
How much is rng?
** Global functions
*** python id()
*** imports
**** math
**** random
** Classes
*** Map
*** Die
*** Character
*** Monster
*** Item
**** offhand
**** mainhand
